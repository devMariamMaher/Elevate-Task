# E-Commerce Website

## Project Description

[Live Demo](https://elevate-task-gamma.vercel.app/home)

This is a fully responsive e-commerce website that dynamically fetches and displays products from the Fake Store API. Built with Angular and styled using Tailwind CSS, it offers a smooth browsing experience with intuitive navigation and dynamic routing for seamless page transitions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, SCSS, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Fake Store API (for product data)
- Routing for navigation
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, if using a local development server)
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser manually, or start a local server using:
   ```sh
   npx live-server
   ```
   (If `live-server` is not installed, you can install it globally using `npm install -g live-server`.)
4. The e-commerce website should now be running locally in your browser.
